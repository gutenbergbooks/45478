      THE GOOD GIRL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Good Girl always minds what Her father and mother say to her; and
      takes pains to learn whatever they are so kind as to teach her. She is
      never noisy nor troublesome; so they like to have her with them, and they
      like to talk to her, and to instruct her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has learned to read so well, and she is so good a girl, that her
      father has given her several <span class="pagenum"><a name="link006"
      id="link006"></a><a href="../45478-page-images/p006.jpg">006</a></span>new
      books, which she reads in by herself, whenever she likes; and she
      understands all that is in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>

    <h5>

    <p>
      She knows the meaning of a great many difficult words; and the names of a
      great many countries, cities, and towns, and she can find them upon a map.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link007" id="link007"></a><a
      href="../45478-page-images/p007.jpg">007</a></span>She can spell almost
      every little sentence that her father asks her to spell; and she can do a
      great many sums on a slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she does, she takes pains to do it well; and when she is doing
      one thing, she tries not to think of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she has made a mistake, or done any thing wrong, she is sorry for it;
      and when she is told of a fault, she endeavours to avoid it another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she wants to know any thing, she asks her father, or her mother, to
      tell her; and she tries to understand, and to remember <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link008" id="link008"></a><a
      href="../45478-page-images/p008.jpg">008</a></span>what they tell her; but
      if they do not think proper to answer her questions, she does not tease
      them, but says, "When I am older, they will perhaps instruct me;" and she
      thinks about something else.
    </p>

      She likes to sit by her mother, and sew, or knit. When she sews, she does
      not take long stitches, nor pucker her work; but does it very neatly, just
      as her mother tells her to do. And she always keeps her work very clean;
      for if her hands are dirty, she washes them before she begins her work:
      and when <span class="pagenum"><a name="link009" id="link009"></a><a
      href="../45478-page-images/p009.jpg">009</a></span>she has finished it,
      she folds it up, and puts it by very carefully, in her work-bag, or in a
      drawer. It is very seldom indeed that she loses her thread, or needles, or
      any thing she has to work with. She does not stick needles on her sleeve,
      nor put pins in her mouth; for she has been told these are silly, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link010" id="link010"></a><a
      href="../45478-page-images/p010.jpg">010</a></span>dangerous tricks; and
      she always pays attention to what is said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She takes care of her own clothes, and folds them up very neatly. She
      knows exactly where she puts them; and, I believe, she could find them
      even in the dark. When she sees a hole in her stockings, or in her frock,
      or any of her clothes, she mends it, or asks her mother to have it mended;
      she does not wait till the hole is very large; for she remembers what her
      mother has told her, that "A stitch in time saves nine."

      She does not like to waste any thing. She is unwilling to throw away or
      burn crumbs of bread, or peelings of fruit, or little bits of muslin,
      linen, or silk; for she has seen the chickens and the little birds picking
      up crumbs, and the pigs feeding upon the peelings of fruit; and she has
      seen the ragman go about gathering rags, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a><a href="../45478-page-images/p012.jpg">012</a></span>which

      She is so dutiful and industrious, that her parents often take her with
      them to ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she goes with her mother, into the kitchen, and the dairy, she takes
      notice of every thing she sees; but she does not meddle with any thing,
      without leave. She knows <span class="pagenum"><a name="link013"
      id="link013"></a><a href="../45478-page-images/p013.jpg">013</a></span>how
      puddings, tarts, butter, and bread, are made.

      She can iron her own clothes; and she can make her own bed. She likes to
      feed the chickens, and the young turkeys, and to give them clean water to
      drink, and to wash themselves in; she likes to work in her little garden,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link014" id="link014"></a><a
      href="../45478-page-images/p014.jpg">014</a></span>to weed it, and to sow
      seeds, and plant roots in it: and she likes to do little jobs for her
      mother: she likes to be employed, and she likes to be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all little girls would be so attentive and industrious, how they would
      delight their parents and their kind friends! and they would be much
      happier themselves, than when they are obstinate, or idle, or ill
      humoured, and will not learn any thing properly, nor mind what is said to
      them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link015" id="link015"></a><a
